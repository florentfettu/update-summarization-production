1344614128-f7374ba455839b2c6c4b596315d56548,0,"(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Im Hundreds of people streamed into a Wisconsin high school Friday to pay their final respects to six worshippers gunned down by a white supremacist at a Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee . Somber, tearful mourners, most wearing scarves on their heads in the Sikh tradition, greeted victims’ family members with hugs at the Oak Creek High School gymnasium . Six open caskets were arranged inside the gymnasium with individual flowers on the bodies and a bouquet on the floor. A large video screen flashed photos of those killed and injured. After they filed past the wooden caskets, mourners took their seats as Sikh singers sang hymns in Punjabi , an Indian dialect. One of the singers paused to translate some lyrics into English. “Dear God , you have given me this body and this soul. This body is doing whatever you want me to do. You take this soul, this is your soul,” he said. Gov . Scott Walker addressed the crowd, telling mourners the Sikh community has shown others that the best way to respond to hate is with love. “Today we mourn with you, we pray with you, we support you,” Walker said. Several dozen police officers stood by in the gym, watching the service. The wake and visitation, initially scheduled to last for two hours, was extended by another two to accommodate mourners who traveled from abroad and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder as a last-minute speaker. Other dignitaries expected to attend include Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan . After the service, mourners planned to return to the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin where the six died and three others were critically wounded Sunday morning. There, priests will read the Sikh holy book from cover to cover in a traditional rite honoring the dead called “ Akhand Path. ” That process takes 48 hours. ""We want to pay homage to the spirits who are still in there,"" said Harpreet Singh , a nephew of one of the victims. Earlier Friday, about two dozen worshippers milled around the temple, where blood-stained carpet had been replaced and some walls had been freshly painted by members allowed inside the day before. One bullet hole in a door jamb leading to the main prayer hall was left unrepaired as a memorial to the shooting victims. Kuldeep Chahal , 35, a Sikh teacher from Toronto , arrived at the temple Friday with several other people after driving for 12 hours. Chahal brought banners and cards that temple members in Canada had signed for families of the victims. “The reason we came down is because we definitely what to show the community how much we support them, ” Chahal said. Federal investigators may never know why 40-year-old Wade Michael Page chose to attack total strangers in a holy place. What they do know is that the Army veteran opened fire with a 9 mm pistol at the temple, shortly before Sunday services were due to begin. Page killed five men and one woman, and injured two other men. Authorities say he then ambushed the first police officer who responded, shooting him nine times and leaving him in critical condition. A second officer then shot Page in the stomach, and Page took his own life with a shot to the head. The officer who was injured, Oak Creek Police Lt. Brian Murphy , was upgraded Thursday to satisfactory condition. The dead included Satwant Singh Kaleka , 65, the temple president who was shot as he tried to fend off Page with a butter knife. The other victims included: — Ranjit Singh , 49, and his 41-year-old brother, Sita Singh , two priests whose families were back in India and whose lives in America revolved around their faith; — Suveg Singh Khattra , 84, a former farmer in India who was a constant presence at the temple; — Prakash Singh , 39, a priest who was remembered as a fun-loving personality who enjoyed telling jokes; and — Paramjit Kaur , 41 who worked 66 hours a week to provide for her family, but also found time to pray every day for at least an hour. The FBI roped off the temple for four days while agents conducted their investigation. They handed the keys back to Sikh leaders Thursday morning.

The City of Cincinnati decided earlier this year to close the general aviation airport, which serves mostly small, recreational aircraft. City officials want to use its aviation resources for Lunken Airport, which is much larger and more successful than the Blue Ash facility. The City of Blue Ash plans to turn the part of the airport that houses its three fixed-base operators into a park with a pavilion, playgrounds, bike and hike trails and other amenities. Use of the Blue Ash Airport has declined steadily. Last year there were only 15,000 landings and take-offs there, compared to 35,000 in 1995. Cincinnati sold 130 of the airport's 230 acres to Blue Ash in 2007, and the City planned to reconfigure the airport on its remaining 100 acres. Cincinnati concluded recently, however, that the airport would be too big of a financial liability. In a March 9 report to City Council , Cincinnati City Manager Milton Dohoney Jr. said operating the airport over the next 10 years would cost $190,000 a year because of $40,000 annual losses in revenue and the cost of FAA -required improvements. A partial reconfiguration of the airport on the city's 100 acres would cost $2.2 million, while a full reconfiguration would run $16 million. Last month, Cincinnati City Hall restructured the $37.2 million sale so that the proceeds would be available to help fund the $110 million-plus streetcar project. City officials previously said they hoped to use money from the airportÂ s sale to cover payments on about $11 million in streetcar bonds. The Federal Aviation Administration , however, raised objections, telling City Hall it would have to keep the sale revenue within its airport system, including Lunken in the East End . By rescinding the original sale and approving a new deal with some procedural changes, the city was able to sidestep that problem. At one time, the Blue Ash Airport site was envisioned as a regional aviation hub. It was known as Grisard Field when founded in 1921. The airfield was commercially leased and later sold to brothers Hugh and Parks Watson . Following the 1937 flood, civic leaders began looking at the Blue Ash location as an alternative to Lunken Airport, which had been completely submerged by the rising waters of the Ohio River . The new airport never came to fruition and in 1946 the airport was sold to the City of Cincinnati and renamed Blue Ash Airport. As land around the site continued to be developed, plans for a major airport in Blue Ash diminished and ultimately died. The airport remained a general aviation airport that hosted air shows and housed small charter aircraft, but over the years air traffic continued to decline.

Highways are maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation . Florida 's interstate highway system contains 1,473 miles (2,371 km ) of highway, and there are 9,934 miles (15,987 km ) of non-interstate highway in the state, such as Florida state highways and U.S. Highways . In 2011, there were about 9,000 retail gas stations in the state. On an average day, Floridians consume 21 million gallons of gasoline, ranking it third in national use. Motorists have the 45th worst rate of car insurance in the country. 24% are uninsured. Drivers between 15 and 19 years of age averaged 364 car crashes a year per ten thousand licensed Florida drivers in 2010. Drivers 70 and older averaged 95 per 10,000 during the same time frame. A spokesperson for the non-profit Insurance Institute said that Older drivers are more of a threat to themselves."" State highways are numbered according to convention. The first digits of state highways are numbered with the first digit indicating what area of the state the road is in, from 1 in the north and east to 9 in the south and west. Major north-south state roads generally have one- or two-digit odd route numbers that increase from east to west, while major east-west state roads generally have one- or two-digit even route numbers that increase from north to south. Roads of secondary importance usually have three-digit route numbers. The first digit x of their route number is the same as the first digit of the road with two-digit number x 0 to the immediate north. The three-digit route numbers also increase from north to south for even numbers and east to west for odd numbers. Following this convention, State Road 907 , or Alton Rd. on Miami Beach , is farther east than State Road 997 , which is Krome Ave, or the farthest west north-south road in Miami - Dade County . One notable exception to the convention is State Road 826 , or the Palmetto Expressway (pictured at the right heading north) which, although even numbered, is signed north-south. State roads can have anywhere from one to four digits depending on the importance and location of the road. County roads often follow this same system. Prior to the construction of routes under the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 , Florida began construction of a long cross-state toll road , Florida 's Turnpike . The first section, from Fort Pierce south to the Golden Glades Interchange was completed in 1957. After a second section north through Orlando to Wildwood (near present-day The Villages ), and a southward extension around Miami to Homestead , it was finished in 1974. Florida 's primary interstate routes include: 20px I -4 , which bisects the state, connecting Tampa , Lakeland , Orlando , and Daytona Beach , connecting with I-95 in Daytona Beach and I-75 in Tampa . 20px I -10 , which traverses the panhandle , connecting Jacksonville , Lake City , Tallahassee and Pensacola , with junctions with I-95 in Jacksonville and I -75 in Lake City . 20px I -75 , which enters the state near Lake City ( west of Jacksonville ) and continues southward through Gainesville , Ocala , Tampa 's eastern suburbs, Bradenton , Sarasota , Fort Myers and Naples , where it crosses the "" Alligator Alley "" as a toll road to Fort Lauderdale before turning southward and terminating in Hialeah / Miami Lakes having junctions with I-10 in Lake City and I-4 in Tampa . 20px I -95 , which enters the state near Jacksonville and continues along the Atlantic Coast through Daytona Beach Melbourne / Titusville , Palm Bay , Vero Beach , Fort Pierce , Port Saint Lucie , Stuart , West Palm Beach , and Fort Lauderdale before terminating in Downtown Miami , with junctions with I-10 in Jacksonville and I -4 in Daytona Beach . Intercity rail Florida is served by Amtrak , operating numerous lines throughout, connecting the state's largest cities to points north in the United States and Canada . The busiest Amtrak train stations in Florida in 2011 were: Sanford (259,944), Orlando (179,142), Tampa Union Station (140,785), Miami (94,556), and Jacksonville (74,733). Sanford , in Greater Orlando , is the southern terminus of the Amtrak Auto Train , which originates at Lorton , Virginia , south of Washington , D.C.. Orlando is also the eastern terminus of the Sunset Limited , which travels across the southern United States via New Orleans , Houston , and San Antonio to its western terminus of Los Angeles . Florida is served by two additional Amtrak trains (the Silver Star and the Silver Meteor ), which operate between New York City and Miami . Miami Central Station , the city's new union station is under construction, and is expected to be completed in 2013. The Miami metropolitan area is connected by Tri -rail , a long line with 18 stations which operates on Amtrak rails. The Florida Department of Transportation was preparing to build a high speed rail between Tampa , Lakeland and Orlando . This was to be the first phase of the Florida High Speed Rail system. Soil work began in July 2010 and construction of the line was slated to begin in 2011, with the initial Tampa- Orlando phase completed by 2014. The second phase, would have extended the line to Miami . Governor Scott, however, refused federal funds and the project has been canceled. Airports Major international airports in Florida which processed more than 15 million passengers each in 2010 are Miami International Airport (35,698,025), Orlando International Airport (34,877,899), Fort Lauderdale - Hollywood International Airport (22,412,627) and Tampa International Airport (16,645,765). Secondary airports, with annual passenger traffic exceeding 5 million each in 2010, include Southwest Florida International Airport ( Fort Myers ) (7,514,316), Palm Beach International Airport ( West Palm Beach ) (5,887,723), and Jacksonville International Airport (5,601,500). Florida 's extensive coastline made it a perceived target during World War II, so the government built airstrips throughout the state; today, approximately 400 airports are still in service. According to the National Drug Intelligence Center , Florida has 131 public airports, and more than 700 private airports, airstrips, heliports, and seaplane bases. Sports Fourteen, about half, of all Major League Baseball teams conduct spring training in the state. Throughout MLB history other teams, at one time or another, held spring training in Florida . Yet Florida did not have a permanent major-league-level professional sports team until the American Football League added the Miami Dolphins in 1966. The state now has three NFL teams, two MLB teams, two NBA teams, and two NHL teams. The state of Florida has given professional sports franchises some subsidies in the form of tax breaks since 1991. Three of the Arena Football League 's teams are in Florida . Golf, tennis, and auto racing are popular. NASCAR (headquartered in Daytona Beach ) begins all three of its major Series in Florida at Daytona International Speedway , and ends all three Series in November at Homestead- Miami Speedway . The PGA of America is headquartered in Palm Beach Gardens while the LPGA is headquartered in Daytona Beach. Minor league baseball, football , basketball, ice hockey , soccer and indoor football teams are based in Florida . Florida 's universities have a number of collegiate sport teams. Florida is the traditional home for Major League Baseball spring training , with teams informally organized into the "" Grapefruit League "". !Club !League ! Venue !

(feature length film) Order: Reorder Duration : 103:07 Published: 07 Nov 2006 Updated: 05 Sep 2012 Author : mickmccleery Every year in the United States 30000 people commit murder. In that same time 60000 people commit suicide. Wouldn't it be great if someone could get these people together? THE PLOT: Tom Taylor is a sick man. His prognosis is final, his illness fatal. But he has one hope. To exit this world with his pride intact and on his own terms. The only good news is, he has found a company that can help him do this. That company is 'Terminal Assist', and they have agreed to match Tom with a professional killer. Tom waits in his house for his all-too-willing executioner. Things go awry when the killer decides to murder Tom's wife, too, and Tom must become a killer to save his wife. This blood bath results in a double homicide and is soon all over the local news. This doesn't suit the purposes of Terminal Assist, an altruistic service that strives to hook up terminally ill people with low-life hit men that enjoy killing. Founder Nick Andrews has established a working relationship with local police authorities, based on an understanding that they won't kill anyone living in the same community. The double homicide presents problems, and the police expect Nick to find a way to relieve the pressure. Complications ensue when it's soon apparent that Nick has a thing for the grieving widow Teresa , and he has competition—namely, Tom 's doctor buddy Carl.

Thinking that some girl named Saroj ( Moushumi Chatterjee ) is taking advantage of Anand , he secretly marries her , and abandons her . Vijay 's mentor is Rai saheb ( Ashok Kumar ), who had deserted his wife ( Nirupa Roy ) and his daughter Saroj, and son, Chandu ( Rakesh Roshan ). Rai saheb unknowingly hires Saroj as a lady servant for his two daughters, one of whom is Laxmi ( Sarika ) who is secretly in love with Vijay , and other one, very young, is handicapped and confined to a wheelchair. Vijay and her dad want Laxmi to marry Anand, which she refuses. Chandu has fallen into bad company of a criminal boss (Prem Chopra ) and his sidekick Kitty ( Komila Virk ). Unknowingly Chandu assaults his very own father, and kidnaps his younger sister to satisfy the boss. Saroj is determined to honor the marriage, but Vijay is not. Will these two ever get together? Will it be too late for Chandu to make amends? http ://wn. com/Dil _ Aur_Deewar Naach Govinda Naach Order: Reorder Duration : 140:01 Published: 25 Oct 2011 Updated: 11 Sep 2012 Author: rajshri Govinda ( Govinda ) lives with his mother ( Anjana Mumtaz ) and they struggle with poverty in their daily life.

A judge of Sindh High Court ’s Larkana bench has granted bail to three owners of a garment factory in the southern city of Karachi where a fire this week killed 258 people, a defense lawyer said Friday. Amir Mansoob Qureshi said the judge instructed the police that the factory owners cannot be arrested for eight days under bail terms. The court also asked the owners to surrender their passports and ordered them not to leave the country, the lawyer said. Police have opened a murder case and are investigating whether possible negligence by the owners and managers of the garment factory led to the massive loss of life. The fire that broke out Tuesday night was the deadliest industrial accident in Pakistan s 65-year history, and highlighted the woeful safety conditions that exist at many factories around the country. People caught in the basement suffocated when it filled with smoke while those on the higher floors were forced to break through metal bars over the windows and jump for their lives to the ground below. Panicked workers had only one way out since the factory s owner had locked all the other exit doors in response to a recent theft. The fire started when a boiler exploded and the flames ignited chemicals that were stored in the factory, which manufactured jeans and other clothes for export.
