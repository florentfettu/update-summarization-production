Isaac was one of the three patriarchs of the Israelites . According to the Book of Genesis , Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born, and Sarah was beyond childbearing years. Isaac was the only biblical patriarch whose name was not changed, and the only one who did not leave Canaan . Compared to those of Abraham and Jacob , Isaac 's story relates fewer incidents of his life. He died when he was 180 years old, making him the longest-lived patriarch. Etymology The anglicized name Isaac is a transliteration of the Hebrew term which literally means "" He laughs/will laugh."" Ugaritic texts dating from the 13th century BCE refer to the benevolent smile of the Canaanite deity El . Genesis , however, ascribes the laughter to Isaac 's parents, Abraham and Sarah , rather than El. According to the biblical narrative, Abraham fell on his face and laughed when Elohim imparted the news of their son's eventual birth. He laughed because Sarah was past the age of childbearing; both she and Abraham were advanced in age. Later , when Sarah overheard three messengers of the Lord renew the promise, she laughed inwardly for the same reason. Sarah denied laughing when Elohim questioned Abraham about it. Isaac in Genesis The account of Isaac from the Book of Genesis Isaac is mentioned by name 80 times in Genesis. Birth of Isaac It was prophesied to the patriarch Abraham that he would have a son and that his name should be called Isaac. When Abraham became one hundred years old, this son was born to him by his first wife Sarah. Though this was Abraham 's second son it was Sarah ’s first and only child. On the eighth day from his birth, Isaac was circumcised , as was necessary for all males of Abraham 's household, in order to be in compliance with Yahweh 's covenant. After Isaac had been weaned, Sarah saw Ishmael mocking , and urged her husband to banish Hagar and Ishmael so that Isaac would be Abraham 's only heir. Abraham was hesitant, but at God's order he listened to his wife's request. Binding of Isaac At some point in Isaac 's youth, his father Abraham brought him to mount Moriah . At God 's command, Abraham was to build a sacrificial altar and sacrifice his son Isaac upon it. After he had bound his son to the altar and drawn his knife to kill him , at the very last moment an angel of God prevented Abraham from proceeding. Rather , he was directed to sacrifice a nearby ram instead. This event served as a test of Abraham 's faith in God, not as an actual human sacrifice. Family life When Isaac was 40, Abraham sent Eliezer , his steward, into Mesopotamia to find a wife for Isaac , from his nephew Bethuel 's family. Eliezer chose Rebekah for Isaac . After many years of marriage to Isaac , Rebekah had still not given birth to a child and was believed to be barren. Isaac prayed for her and she conceived. Rebekah gave birth to twin boys, Esau and Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when his two sons were born. Isaac favored Esau, and Rebekah favored Jacob . Occupation At the age of 75, Isaac moved to Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land experienced famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still under the control of King Abimelech as it was in the days of Abraham . Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So , Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba , where he made a pact with Abimelech , just like in the day of his father. Birthright Isaac grew old and became blind. He called his son Esau and directed him to procure some venison for him , in order to receive Isaac 's blessing. While Esau was hunting, Jacob , after listening to his mother's advice, deceived his blind father by misrepresenting himself as Esau and thereby obtained his father's blessing, such that Jacob became Isaac 's primary heir and Esau was left in an inferior position. Isaac sent Jacob into Mesopotamia to take a wife of his own family. After 20 years working for Laban , Jacob returned home, and reconciled with his twin brother Esau , then he and Esau buried their father when Isaac died at the age of 180. Other references New Testament In the New Testament , there are references to Isaac having been ""offered up"" by his father, and to his blessing his sons. Paul contrasted Isaac , symbolizing Christian liberty , with the rejected older son Ishmael , symbolizing slavery; Hagar is associated with the Sinai covenant, while Sarah is associated with the covenant of grace, into which her son Isaac enters. The Epistle of James chapter 2, verses 21-24 states that the sacrifice of Isaac shows that justification (in the Johannine sense) requires both faith and works. In the early Christian church , Abraham 's willingness to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac was used as an example of faith and of obedience. The Epistle to the Hebrews chapter 11, verse 19 views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the resurrection of Jesus , the idea of the sacrifice of Isaac being a prefigure of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross . Qur 'an The Qur'an mentions Isaac as a righteous man of God . Isaac and Jacob are mentioned as being bestowed upon Abraham as gifts of God, who then worshipped God only and were righteous leaders in the way of God: }} Testament of Isaac The Testament of Isaac is a pseudonym ous text which was most likely composed in Greek in Egypt after 100 CE. It is also dependent on the Testament of Abraham . In this testament, God sends the archangel Michael to Isaac in order to inform him of his impending death. Isaac accepts God's decree but Jacob resists. Isaac in his bed-chamber tells Jacob of the inevitability of death. Isaac has a tour of heaven and hell shortly before his death in which God's compassion to repentant sinners is emphasized. In this testament, Isaac also talks with the crowds on the subjects of priest hood, asceticism , and the moral life. World views The early Christian church viewed Abraham's willingness to follow God 's command to sacrifice Isaac as an example of faith and obedience. For Christians, Abraham 's willingness to sacrifice his son is a ""type and shadow"" of God's willingness to sacrifice his only son, Jesus . Islam considers Isaac as a prophet of Islam , and describes him as the father of the Israelites and a righteous servant of God . Documentary hypothesis The name Isaac occurs 32 times in the Hebrew Bible. Variations of the formula "" Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob "" occur 23 times in the Hebrew Bible. According to the documentary hypothesis , use of names of God indicates authorship, and form critic s variously assign passages like Genesis chapter 26, verses 6-11 to the Yahwist source, and Genesis chapter 20 verses 1-7, chapter 21, verse 1 to chapter 22, verse 14 and chapter 22, verse 19 to the Elohist source; this source-critical approach has admitted problems, in that the name "" Yahweh "" appears in Elohist material. According to the compilation hypothesis, the formulaic use of the word toledoth (generations) indicates that Genesis chapter 11, verse 27 to chapter 25, verse 19 is Isaac 's record through Abraham 's death (with Ishmael 's record appended), and Genesis chapter 25, verse 19 to chapter 37, verse 2 is Jacob 's record through Isaac 's death (with Esau 's records appended). Jewish views In rabbinical tradition the age of Isaac at the time of binding is taken to be 37 which contrasts with common portrayals of Isaac as a child. The rabbi s also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice of Isaac . The sacrifice of Isaac is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and largely focus on Abraham 's intended sacrifice of Isaac , called the aqedah (""binding""). According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah , unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac and not God . Isaac 's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyr dom to violation of the Jewish law . According to the Jewish tradition Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer. This tradition is based on Genesis chapter 24, verse 63 ("" Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide""). Isaac was the only patriarch who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God told him not to do so. Rabbinic tradition gave the explanation that Isaac was almost sacrificed and anything dedicated as a sacrifice may not leave the Land of Israel . Isaac was the oldest of the biblical patriarchs at the time of his death, and the only patriarch whose name was not changed. Rabbinic literature also linked Isaac 's blindness in old age, as stated in the Bible, to the sacrificial binding: Isaac 's eyes went blind because the tears of angels present at the time of his sacrifice fell on Isaac 's eyes. The Qur'an states that Abraham received ""good tidings of Isaac , a prophet, of the righteous"", and that God blessed them both ( XXXVII : 12). In a fuller description, when angel s came to Abraham to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on Sodom and Gomorrah , his wife, Sarah , ""laughed, and We gave her good tidings of Isaac , and after Isaac of (a grandson) Jacob"" (XI : 71-74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite Abraham and Sarah 's old age. Several verses speak of Isaac as a ""gift"" to Abraham (VI: 84; XIX : 49-50), and XXIX : 26-27 adds that God made ""prophethood and the Book to be among his offspring"", which has been interpreted to refer to Abraham 's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson Jacob , and his prophetic great-grandson Joseph . In the Qur 'an , it later narrates that Abraham also praised God for giving him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age ( XIV : 39-41). Elsewhere in the Qur'an , Isaac is mentioned in lists: Joseph follows the religion of his forefathers Abraham , Isaac and Jacob (XII : 38) and speaks of God 's favor to them (XII: 6); Jacob 's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the God that their forefathers, "" Abraham , Ishmael and Isaac "", worshiped (II: 127); and the Qur'an commands Muslim s to believe in the revelations that were given to "" Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob and the Patriarchs "" (II: 136; III: 84). In the Qur'an 's narrative of Abraham 's near-sacrifice of his son ( XXXVII : 102), the name of the son is not mentioned and debate has continued over the son's identity, though many feel that the identity is the least important element in a story which is given to show the courage that one develops through faith. Western scholarly views Some scholars have described Isaac as ""a legend ary figure"" while others view him ""as a figure representing tribal history, though as a historical individual"" or ""as a seminomadic leader."" The stories of Isaac , like other patriarchal stories of Genesis , are generally believed in liberal Western scholarship to have ""their origin in folk memories and oral traditions of the early Hebrew pastoralist experience."" Conservative Western scholarship believes the stories of Isaac , and other patriarchal stories in Genesis , to be factual. The Cambridge Companion to the Bible makes the following comment on the biblical stories of the patriarchs : According to Martin Noth , a scholar of the Hebrew Bible , the narratives of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage than that of the West - Jordanian Jacob . At that era, the Israelite tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern Palestine with the inhabitants of the settled countryside. The biblical historian, A. Jopsen , believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces Amos 7:9 (""the high places of Isaac "" ). Albrecht Alt and Martin Noth hold that, ""The figure of Isaac was enhanced when the theme of promise, previously bound to the cults of the 'God the Fathers ' was incorporated into the Israelite creed during the southern-Palestinian stage of the growth of the Pentateuch tradition."" According to Martin Noth , at the Southern Palestinian stage of the growth of the Pentateuch tradition, Isaac became established as one of the biblical patriarchs , but his traditions were receded in the favor of Abraham. In art The earliest Christian portrayal of Isaac is found in the Roman catacomb fresco es. Excluding the fragments, Alison Moore Smith classifies these artistic works in three categories: See also Biblical narratives and the Qur'an Notes () is the traditional Koran ic spelling after vocalizing with a super script .

Isaac 's potential landfall as a Category 1 hurricane as early as Tuesday prompted evacuations along a wide area of the Gulf Coast and sent people out to stock up on staples. As of 11 am EDT Monday, Isaac remained a tropical storm with top sustained winds of 65 mph. Its center was about 310 miles southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River , and it was moving northwest at 14 mph. Isaac barreled past the Florida Keys and was rolling northwestward over the open Gulf of Mexico on Monday.

Late last week the forecast was that what is now Tropical Storm Isaac would hit somewhere around New Orleans or Biloxi Mississippi as a cat 2, it was then forecast as a cat 1, but has since been revised up again to a category 2 hurricane. It looks like it will come ashore sometime around 2 am early Wednesday morning in New Orleans . Right now, residents of outlying areas and Islands are evacuating and moving to higher ground. And I am sure that the Mayor of New Orleans along with many residents that remembered hurricane Katrina are somewhat worried that this storm is on nearly the exact path that Katrina was on and it is scheduled to hit New Orleans on the exact same day Katrina did 7 years ago. Isaac is a huge storm and here in Central Florida , where we are some 600 miles away from the center of the storm, we have experienced rain all day long. The storm has feeder arms that stretch all the way from what looks to be South Carolina to way down south of Cuba. It was the size of Hurricane Katrina at the intensity of a category 3 storm that caused all the devastation along the Gulf Coast. Could hurricane Isaac cause the same problem with the levees in New Orleans that Katrina did and flood the city with the high storm surge again?

The focus has been on New Orleans as Isaac takes dead aim at the city seven years after Hurricane Katrina, but the impact will be felt well beyond the city limits. The storm's winds could be felt more than 200 miles from its center. The Gulf Coast region has been saturated thanks to a wet summer, and some officials have worried more rain could make it easy for trees and power lines to fall over in the wet ground. Too much water also could flood crops, and wind could topple plants such as corn and cotton. ""A large, slow-moving system is going to pose a lot of problems: winds, flooding, storm surge and even potentially down the road river flooding,"" said Richard Knabb , director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami . ""That could happen for days after the event."" The storm's potential for destruction was not lost on Alabama farmer Bert Driskell , who raises peanuts, cotton, wheat, cattle and sod on several thousand acres near Grand Bay , in Mobile County. ""We don't need a lot of water this close to harvest,"" Driskell said. However, Isaac could bring some relief to places farther inland where farmers have struggled with drought. It also may help replenish a Mississippi River that has at times been so low that barge traffic is halted so engineers can scrape the bottom to deepen it.

Federal officials warned of a dangerous storm surge, saying rising water, not wind, was a major concerned. The large, slow-moving storm will push water from the Gulf ashore and dump up to 18 inches of rain on already saturated land. Residents - recalling the fallout from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which destroyed about 80% of New Orleans and killed about 1800 people across the Gulf Coast are stockpiling food, water and other staples. Lines at gas stations were growing and airlines began canceling inbound and outbound flights as the size of the storm expanded. Officials declared emergencies in four states . By Monday afternoon, Isaac had sustained winds of 70 mph and was about 320 miles south to southeast of Mobile, Ala ,. and was moving northwest at 12 mph. The storm is expected to reach hurricane status, with wind speeds of 75 mph, sometime Monday night. At landfall, which is expected sometime between 11 pm Tuesday and 11 am Wednesday, the hurricane should have winds of around 90 mph, which means it would hit as a Category 1 or Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale , the hurricane center reported.

There's a 25 ft tidal wave just off the caribbean Islands heading towards key west florida and the gulf of mexico . The Hurricane ocean currents and tropical winds have gotten it to 20 ft high, I've seen Hurricane winds make them over 30 to 40 ft in height, which i haven't predicted this time. However because of the fact that several category 5 storm hurricane cells have appeared in Isaac , two causing a 25 ft to 27 ft storm surge back in 1969 (hurricane carol and camille ) I've put out a warning. Also there's been a higher than normal amount of earthquakes in the region - clusters from 4.0 to 5.0 and we all know those ALWAYS get higher as time progresses. Based on those facts, I've blogged a prediction for the areas of the pacific ocean, gulf of mexico , caribbean sea and east atlantic coast (also south africa, uk ) should be ready to evacuate within a moments notice - from hurricane winds up to 300 km per hour, or tidal waves hitting the shores, you won't have time to get out of the way. Also if there's an earthquake (stronger than 6.0 magnitude, possible TSUNAMi will hit from 25 to 50 ft in height. that's blogged as well, with proof of earthquake clusters.

With the hurricane expected to reach New Orleans by as early as this evening, here are local residents on the famous bourbon street preparing for its arrival. It is nearly seven years to the day after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city and killed more than 1800 people and caused billions of dollars of damage along the coast. These tourists explained that their flights had been cancelled: ""Our flights were cancelled so we are going to be here for the hurricane so we are battening down the hatches.

People evacuating Southeast Louisiana are finding service stations out of fuel and the traffic leaving the area heavy.. Katrina survivors aren't taking any chances this time around. Isaac took a left turn Sunday in the Gulf of Mexico after brushing the southern tip of Florida . That likely spared the Republican National Convention in Tampa the brunt of the storm, but the city remained under a tropical storm warning. The Republican governors of Louisiana , Mississippi, Alabama and Florida — states vulnerable to the storm — stayed away from the convention. Even so, former presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul drew a big crowd Sunday at a rally away from the official convention site, and convention organizers said the three-day convention would be up and running Tuesday. The path points to the storm landing near Gulfport , Miss. — just 10 miles from Katrina 's greatest storm surges — and striking late Tuesday or early Wednesday. Isaac is a big and potentially powerful storm but isn't expected to pack the punch of Katrina , the most destructive storm in the past 100 years. Winds will be somewhat less that Katrina and, most important, storm surges should be less than half the size of those that devastated New Orleans and coastal Mississippi, according to the National Hurricane &lt; b&gt ;...&lt ;/b&gt ; http ://wn.com/Terror_ in _ the_Gulf _ More _Questions_ than_Answers _for_ LA _ Sinkhole _7_ Years _ Post-Katrina Tropical Storm Isaac Key West ! ! Order: Reorder Duration : 1:27 Published: 27 Aug 2012 Updated: 27 Aug 2012 Author: Lad Dev Tropical Storm Isaac barely stirred Florida Keys residents from their fabled nonchalance Sunday, while the Gulf Coast braced for the possibility that the sprawling storm will strengthen into a dangerous hurricane by the time it makes landfall there. It was on course to strike land on the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a powerful storm that crippled New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and became a symbol of government ineptitude. Forecasters expected Isaac to pass the Keys late Sunday before turning northwest and striking Wednesday as a Category 2 hurricane somewhere between New Orleans and the Florida Panhandle. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for a large swath of the northern Gulf Coast from east of Morgan City , La. - which includes the New Orleans area - to Destin , Fla. A Category 2 hurricane has sustained winds of between 96 and 110 mph. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called a state of emergency, and officials in St. Charles Parish near New Orleans told its 53000 residents to leave ahead of the storm. Jindal also said he may skip a speaking engagement later this week at the Republican National Convention in Tampa unless the threat to his state subsides. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley also has canceled his trip to the convention. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said at a news conference Sunday evening that only minor damage was reported from Isaac .

Tropical Storm Isaac inches Towards Hurricane Strength Similar to Hurricane Katrina Order: Reorder Duration : 1:09 Published: 27 Aug 2012 Updated: 27 Aug 2012 Author: NewsLlVE Tropical Storm Isaac is gaining strength and cutting a path through the Gulf of Mexico that's eerily similar to the catastrophic Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans and the region nearly seven years ago to the day. Isaac 's potential landfall as a Category 1 hurricane as early as Tuesday prompted evacuations along a wide area of the Gulf Coast and sent people out to stock up on staples. As of 11 am EDT Monday, Isaac remained a tropical storm with top sustained winds of 65 mph. Its center was about 310 miles southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River , and it was moving northwest at 14 mph. Isaac barreled past the Florida Keys and was rolling northwestward over the open Gulf of Mexico on Monday. The National Hurricane Center predicted it would grow to a hurricane with winds of between 74 and 95 mph over the warm water and possibly hit sometime Tuesday somewhere along a roughly 300-mile stretch from the bayous southwest of New Orleans to the edge of the Florida Panhandle. Tuesday would be one day shy of seven years after Katrina struck catastrophically in 2005, although Katrina was a much stronger Category 5 storm with winds in excess of 157 miles per hour. Isaac is expected to have top winds of around 90 mph when it hits land. The size of the warning area and the storm's wide bands of rain and wind prompted emergency declarations in four states, and hurricane-tested residents were boarding up homes, stocking up on food and water or getting ready to evacuate &lt ; b& gt;...&lt ;/b&gt ; http ://wn. com / Tropical _ Storm _ Isaac _inches_ Towards _Hurricane_Strength_ Similar_to _Hurricane_ Katrina Major Hurricane Isaac Forecast to hit Northern Gulf by Wednesday Order: Reorder Duration : 3:04 Published: 26 Aug 2012 Updated: 27 Aug 2012 Author: TheWeatherSpaceVideo www.theweatherspace. com ( TheWeatherSpace. com) - TheWeatherSpace. com's TWS - TFM ( Tropical Forecast Models) have come into agreement given the new code with a Major Hurricane into the same spot Hurricane Katrina in 2005 hit.

Maps of the storms' predicted destructive paths highlight their similarities, with Isaac set to strike Louisiana and Mississippi late Tuesday or Wednesday - seven years after Katrina struck the same spot. More than 50000 Louisiana residents have been ordered to evacuate as Isaac picks up strength in the Gulf of Mexico .

The US Gulf Coast is braced for the storm which left at least 20 people dead in Haiti and the Dominican Republic and swept across the Florida Keys. People along a 300 miles stretch of coast have been warned to take precautions, with some communities urged to evacuate and head for shelter.

US President Barack Obama signed an emergency declaration for Louisiana , authorising federal aid for the state ahead of the approaching storm. He has asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts with state and local officials along the Gulf Coast. The storm is expected to make landfall somewhere between the Florida Panhandle and New Orleans - ahead of the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the area seven-years-ago.
